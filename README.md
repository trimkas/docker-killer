This is a tiny script to kill and remove all docker containers.

To use, move the 'bisha' file  into /usr/local/bin like this: 

'sudo mv bisha /usr/local/bin'

After the steps above, you can call the command `bisha` from anywhere in your machine to kill all containers.
Note: If you're having issues, try to give the necessary permission to the file to be executable (chmod -R 777 bisha).
